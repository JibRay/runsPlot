This Python program produces a runner's historical performance plot. The
plot axese are chronological time in days, run distance in miles and pace
in minutes/mile.

The plot shows each run as a dot in the 3D space and a best-fit plane to
show trend over chronological time and run distance.

The input file comes from connect.garmin.com. If you upload your runs to
Garmin Connect you can get this file from the Garmin site.

1. Log in to your account at connect.garmin.com, expand the 'Activites' in
   the main menu on the left of the screen.
2. Select 'All Activities'. You will see a summary display of your activites
   in reverse chronological order.
3. Click the runner symbol to select only runs.
4. Scroll down the list until the first run you want to include is visible at
   the bottom.
5. Click 'Export CSV'. This will put Activites.csv in your Downloads folder.
